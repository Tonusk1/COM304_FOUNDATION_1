My name is Chong and i have not much prior experience to computing however have a little. My interest into coding and computing started 2 years ago and I took a few python courses online over summer holidays in year 12 of school and downloaded apps to tutor myself. One of the main apps i used was an app called SoloLearn which gave me a basic introduction to python. Through this I learned very little baisc skills and knowledge. I was also able to gain some work experience through a family friend who owns the company going by knipkeyer-it.ltd, under them i was taught to update errors and daily reports. Within my time with the company, I was taught the basics on how to start up a raspbery pi, but did not manage to get very far due to personal reasons. Other experience I have is just from reading a Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. Throgh this module I would like to learn the basics of coding and computing and be able to read languages such as C, Python, etc.
